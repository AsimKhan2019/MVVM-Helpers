**Project Description**
MvvmHelpers is a cross-platform library for creating applications using the Model-View-ViewModel pattern which was popularized by the XAML frameworks. 

The library supports:
* .NET 4.5
* Mono 4.5
* Windows Store Apps (WinRT)
* Windows Phone Apps (WinPRT)
* Xamarin.iOS
* Xamarin.Android

There are several examples available [here](http://www.julmar.com/blog/mark?cat=8) where I've been blogging on how to use this library.  I'll push some of that information up here as well.

You can install MvvmHelpers through NuGet [http://www.nuget.org](http://www.nuget.org) - just search for MVVMHelpers.PCL, it will add the latest version into your project automatically from within Visual Studio if you install the NuGet plug-in.

Alternatively, you can type the following into the Package Manager console to add it to your project:

```
PM> Install-Package MVVMHelpers.PCL
```
